# BeggarRoyale
This is the source code of a python game based on pygame. It is about a person who donates to keep the begars away from his stash
This is about money, where everybody from the whole community wants your money, and they are going to be stealing for your money, and they want your stockpile which is worth millions! The more people you give money to, the more your money multiplier will increase. every time you give a beggar money, they will give you 2* money. the higher up you go, there will be more risk.
